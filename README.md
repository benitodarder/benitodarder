- 👋 Hi, I’m @benitodarder
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, clean and readable over obfuscated... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever it takes to improve my skills, and using Github to keep the simple basic examples of different languages/libraries/frameworks... To quickly build a test when needed.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that could fit in my schedule
- 📫 How to reach me? Easily in linkedin with same user name
